      Main Focus: A creative, observant, and self-driven team player always
      striving to learn and contribute insightful solutions to challenging
      problems. Eager to expand my knowledge in robotics, mechanical and
      electrical engineering, and computer science seeking a unique opportunity
      for January to April 2022. EDUCATION Wentworth Institute of Technology |
      Boston, MA B.S. Electromechanical Engineering, Minor in Computer Science.
      | GPA: 3.97/4.00 Interdisciplinary degree with a focus on mechanical
      engineering, electrical engineering, electromechanical systems (ABET
      accredited) Memberships: Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers
      (IEEE), Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV), Robotics, Accelerate Relevant
      Courses: Analog Circuit Design, Signals and Systems, Mechanics of
      Materials, Thermodynamics, Computer Science 1, MATLAB PROFESSIONAL
      EXPERIENCE DEKA Research and Development Controls Intern April 2019 -
      Sept. 2019 | June 2020 – July 2021 Manchester, NH ● Responsible for
      designing and running multiple electrical, mechanical (impact and thermal)
      tests on biomedical devices. ● Worked directly under lead Controls
      engineer to design and implement a PID controlled heating and cooling
      system to operate safely and efficiently via Modbus TCP/IP and LabVIEW. ●
      Designed an RFID organization system via Modbus TCP/IP and LabVIEW to
      track and manage subsystem components. ○ Integrated this system to work
      with Python and SQL for Batch Production Records. ● Led effort to create a
      versatile test bench that streamlines multi-source serial data
      autonomously using Arduino and Python. ● Assisted in testing System-level
      FDA requirements, analyzing results, and giving feedback for improving
      anomalous behavior: ○ This feedback loop allowed for constant operating
      procedure improvements to increase quality of output data. ● Engaged in
      subsystem-level requirements meetings to brainstorm new test methods.
      Dry-ran informal procedures for initial verification of test methods. ●
      Received formal training on Electro-static discharge, good documentation
      practices and Scale Lab Operations (Precision Scales, Environmental
      Chambers, Pressure Gauges, Temperature Loggers). ● Accepted greater
      responsibility that was quickly given to me after demonstrating
      understanding and capability to contribute high quality outputs. FIRST
      Robotics Intern March 2019 - June 2019 Manchester, NH • Designed and
      assembled baseline robots for FIRST demonstration events. Created
      long-term solutions at competitive costs. • Modeled 3D printed hardstops,
      which were dynamic enough to be used with different robot models over
      years. • Contributed to source-controlled software suite, ensuring new
      updates did not conflict within teams. SKILLS ● Trilingual (English &
      Arabic, conversational Spanish) ● SOLIDWORKS CSWA ● 3D Printing ● Java,
      Python, MATLAB, LabVIEW, C, C++ ● Arduino, Raspberry Pi ● Windows, Linux,
      Android ● Git and Surround version control ● General electrical wiring ●
      AC/DC electrical circuitry and diagrams ● Soldering ● Program and
      electrical debugging ● Statics and dynamics calculations ● Simple machine
      work ● Public speaking RELEVANT ACTIVITIES & PROJECTS Turnafit Project
      Sept. 2018 – May 2021 ● Developed a biomedical device to efficiently
      decrease blood loss on the way to a hospital by using inflation mechanisms
      and blood clotting technologies ● Researched and designed prototypes which
      were presented in front of EMTs, patent lawyers, and entrepreneurs to
      receive feedback. Robotics - FRC Team 5813 “Morpheus” June 2017 - May 2019
      ● Worked with senior engineers and college mentors: designing, building,
      and testing software, electrical, and mechanical subsystems. ● Programmed
      telemetry commands for the robot. ● Used PixyCam to help the robot
      autonomously track its target. ○ Won a “Design and Innovation award” for
      this program. ● Mentored team Java proficiency and provide continued
      assistance with the development of the robot.
